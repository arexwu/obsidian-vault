### [[Consumer Surplus]]
- The amount a consumer pays - amount consumer was willing to pay
	- IE auction: willing to pay 1000 but only pays 8000

	- *The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market

	- Consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well being
		- if policymakers want to satisfy a buyer's preferences
		- The only exception is if someone's benefit from consumer surplus is detrimental to society IE. addicts and drugs
### [[Producer surplus]]
- Amount a seller is paid - cost of production

- **The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market

- makes explanation why to get in early, more seller surplus
### total surplus and market efficiency
- [[total surplus]] = Value to buyers - cost to sellers
- if an allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, then the allocation exhibits efficiency
- If it is not efficient, some of the potential gains are not realized\
- [[competitive markets]] allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them most
- competitive markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce them at the lowest cost
- competitive markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus
- ![[Pasted image 20231002200006.png]]
- below equilibrium level
	- when the quantity is less than the equilibrium level, not enough is being consumed, so by increasing the amount sold, total surplus can be increased
- Above equilibrium level
	- when the quantity is more than the equilibrium level, too much is being consumed, meaning, the benefit that the buyer gets is less than the cost that the seller incurs.
	- reducing quantity will increase total surplus as it avoid making buyers worse off
- [[Market power]]
	- the ability of a single group to influence the market (monopoly)
	- market failure occurs when market power and other externalities such as pollution make an unregulated market become inefficient at allocating resources
# Chapter In a nutshell
- Consumer surplus = buyer willingness(amt) - amount they actually pay
- producer surplus = amt sellers are paid - cost of production
- allocation of resources that maximizes total surplus = efficient
- in normal conditions equilibrium maximizes total surplus
- markets do not allocate resources efficiently in the presence of market failures such as market power of externalities
