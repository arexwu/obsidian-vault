-  nucleus emits/captures particles and energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation
	- Most common types
		- alpha particle emission
		- beta particle emission
			- electron emission
			- positron emission
		- electron capture
			- nucleus captures a core electron and converts it into a proton
		- gamma radiation emission
- why do some nuclei decay
	- 1:1 neutron/proton ratio
- Stable nuclei
	- number of neutrons generally are more than protons so strong force overcomes P+ P+ repulsion
	- have <92 protons
- number of atoms in universe is decreasing
