Valence electrons from one atom become attracted to the other nucleus
- each nucleus is attracting both electrons
- bond length is most stable distance between the atoms(lowest potential energy)
- strong
- caused by the attraction of electrons from one atom to nucleus of another atom
- hard to predict bond strength
- present only when atomic orbital interact constructively
- present within molecules/networks
