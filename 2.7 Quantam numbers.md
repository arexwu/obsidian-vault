- 3 different quantum numbers, n, l, ml
	- n is the principle quantum number, where n can equal 1, 2, 3, 4
	- the higher the value of n, the higher the overall energy level of the electron shell
	- for each value on n, there are only certain allowable values of l, and for each value of l, only certain allowable values for ml
	- each orbital defines the space in which he probability of finding an electron is 90%
	- two electrons within a particular orbital must be different in some way
		- this difference is [[spin]]
			- quantum number ms
			- values of +-1/2
			- responsible for magnetism
# effective nuclear charge
- net positive charge felt by the outermost electrons from the nucleus
- Lithium's orbital is 1s^2, 2s^1
	- quantum mechanical calculations say that the electron in the 2s orbital, will take less energy to remove than the 1s orbital
		- furthermore 1s electrons shield the 2s orbital from the nucleus
	- Real charge - shielding from the 1s electrons = effective nuclear charge
- As you go across any row in the periodic table, the atomic radius decreases, meaning, effective nuclear charge is increasing
- exceptions, boron, oxygen
	- Boron has a p orbital, which is a little further from the nucleus, so electron is easier to remove
	- Oxygen has 4 p orbitals, p only has 3 orbitals, meaning that one orbital must have 2 electrons, which will lead to some repulsion, leading to lower ionization energy
- Electrons in the inner and filled quantum shells are relatively inert
