### abnormal regulation of blood glucose
- hyper glycemia 
	- high blood glucose levels
	- associated with diabetes
	- metabolic syndrome
		- diabetes, cardiovascular disease
- Hypoglycemia
	- low blood glucose levels
### glycemic response
- blood glucose response to eating carbohydrates
- Glycemic index
	- method of classifying food according to their potential for raising blood glucose
	- Foods with low GI may lower risk for heart disease, improve blood lipids, reduce inflammation
	- High >70
	- intermediate 55-69
	- low <55
- Glycemic Load
	- Amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by the glycemic index of that carbohydrate divided by 100
	- High >20 
	- intermediate 11-19
	- low <10
- Recommended carbohydrate intake
	- 130g, amount needed for cns function
	- AMDR 45-65% of total energy needs
	- non-nutritive sweeteners potentially leading to insulin resistance
