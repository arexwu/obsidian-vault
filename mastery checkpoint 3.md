would every element have London dispersion forces?(jar of iron)

potential energy decrease would happen as the strong nuclear force takes hold?

would boron have ionic or covalent bonds?

elements would be a network if sigma bonds are present

difference between ionic and metallic bonds

z= protons
a= atomic mass
