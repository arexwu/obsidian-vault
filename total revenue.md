Price * Quantity = Total revenue
	- basically, on the graph, multiply x and y
- How does it change:
	- If inelastic- increase in price = increase in revenue
	- Because, in the case of P * Q Q drop proportionally less than price[[definition of elasticity]]
		- Opposite occurs when it is elastic, as q drops proportionally more than P[[definition of elasticity]]
