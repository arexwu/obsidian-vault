	- In the above figure, shows the relation between amount supply and the elasticity of supply
		- When low levels are supply, the elasticity is high, meaning firms will respond substantially to price increases. 
			- It also means that in this region, firms have excess amounts production available
		- When high levels of supply, elasticity is low, as increasing production is now hard, meaning firms have little to no excess production capabilities
