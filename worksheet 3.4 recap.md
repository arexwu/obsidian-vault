# bonding in diamond
- each carbon atom forms 4 bonds to 4 identical carbon atoms
- tetrahedrol bonding as the bonds arrange themselves towards a tetrahedron
- bond angle is 109.5 degrees
- diamonds do not melt
- why do [[metals]] melt
	-  cores are held together by a sea of electrons, so when the cores move, the electrons move with them
- [[Sigma bonds]]
	- form when atomic orbitals overlap end to end
	- very strong, reason why diamonds melt as these hold the atomic cores together

- diamond properties explained
	- Hard and high melting/boiling point
		- 3d network of strong bonds
		- need to break these bonds to melt
	- does not conduct electricity
		- very large band gap between atoms
		- electrons are localized so they cannot roam
- translucent
	- do not absorb photons as that would cause electrons to be promoted, impossible because of [[localized electrons]]
# Graphite
- trigonal planar bonds
	- bond angle of 120
- when the sp2 orbitals combine they form sigma bond molecular orbitals
- ![[Pasted image 20231017135035.png]]
- each sheet is bonded with sigma bonds, but the sheet above is bonded to the other sheet by delocalized [[pi orbitals]]
- Properties explained
	- conducts electricity
		- electrons can move freely over the entire sheet through the pi orbitals
	- shiny
		- pi orbitals allow it to absorb photons of many wavelengths
	- slippery
		- sheets slide over each other as they are only held together by [[London dispersion forces]]
[[Valence bond theory]]
- atomic orbitals overlap to form bonds
- bonds are shown as sticks H-H
- greater the overlap stronger the bond
- each bond is made up of 2 electrons
- [[localized electrons]]
- n atomic orbitals form n hybrid orbitals
