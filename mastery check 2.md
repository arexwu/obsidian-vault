1. Describe the relationship between the frequency, wavelength, and velocity (speed) of a wave.
2. Draw and compare two waves of different frequency, wavelength, or amplitude.
3. Calculate any one (frequency, wavelength, or velocity) given the other two. Use appropriate units.
4. Rank electromagnetic radiation (gamma ray, X-ray, UV, visible, IR, radio wave, microwave) in terms of energy, wavelength, or frequency.
5. Describe and identify experimental evidence for why electromagnetic radiation is a wave.
6. Make an argument (include claim, evidence, and reasoning) about why we can consider electromagnetic radiation as a wave.
7. Describe and identify experimental evidence for why electromagnetic radiation is a particle.
8. Using the photoelectric effect experiment, draw and explain graphs that show the number of electrons ejected vs. frequency or wavelength of radiation that shines on the metal.
9. Calculate the energy of photons of a given frequency or wavelength (and vice versa).
10. Explain why the existence of photons (quantized light energy) explains the photoelectric effect.
11. Make an argument (include claim, evidence, and reasoning) about why we can consider electromagnetic radiation as a particle.
12. Explain how (and why) different atoms emit different wavelengths of light.
13. Compare and contrast atomic emission and absorption spectra and how they are generated.
14. Use spectra to identify the presence of elements (by comparison, not calculation).
15. Make an argument for why spectra are direct evidence for the existence of quantized energy levels in an atom.

26. Identify valence and core electrons.
27. Predict trends in atomic radii and ionization energies based on placement in the periodic table.
