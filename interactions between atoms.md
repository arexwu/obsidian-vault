- isolated atoms cannot exist in a state
# emergent properties
- properties of a reactant are not related to reactants
- properties depend on the bonds/interactions that exist within the substance
# [[Covalent bonds]]
- Valence electrons from one atom become attracted to the other nucleus
- each nucleus is attracting both electrons
- bond length is most stable distance between the atoms(lowest potential energy)
- bonds form = energy released
