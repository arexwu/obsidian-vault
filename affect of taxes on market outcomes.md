		- Tax is not imposed on buyers 
		- quantity demanded makes price the same
		- Shifts supply curve

- Implications
	- same as when taxes are levied on sellers but just reverse
	- the wedge remains the same

	- A lawmaker can decide whether taxes come from a seller or buyer's pocket but cannot decide the true burden of a tax
