### λν = c
- λ= wavelength
- v= frequency
- c=  velocity of light 3.00x10^8
### wave theory
- Light is a type of wave
- Explains [[interference]] and [[diffraction]]
- [[Electromagnetic theory of light]]
	- James Clerk
	- visible light and other forms of radiation are viewed in terms of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields
- disproved by Planck's model
### Planck's model
- Discovered that light travels in packets, quanta
- E=hv
- E= energy
- h= Planck's constant
- v= frequency of light
## 2.2 taking quanta seriously
### photons and shit
- Intensity of light is related to the number of protons that pass by per second
- Energy per proton is dependent on frequency/wavelength
	- Wavelength is inversely related to frequency
		- This means that energy is directly related to frequency due to E=hv = hc/v
		- this means that short wavelength has much more energy per particle than long wavelength radiation
	- Relates back to worksheet 2.1
		- This is why longer wavelengths produced less electrons
			- photons at longer wavelengths did not have enough energy to eject a electron
		- Once wavelength is short enough to eject electrons, increasing intensity of the light increases the number of electrons emitted.
		- Einstein says: Only photons with enough energy could eject an electron from an atom
			- Enough energy to overcome attraction between electrons and nucleus
