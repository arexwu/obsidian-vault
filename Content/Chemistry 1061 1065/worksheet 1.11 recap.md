### formation of covalent bonds
- interaction of hydrogen is closer than helium as it forms a [[Bonds]]
- when 2 hydrogens form bonds, they form a new chemical species H2
	- very different properties
	- under normal conditions, hydrogen is diatomic
	- other diatomic molecules O2, N2, Cl2, Br2. I2
	- [[Why do diatomic molecules happen]]
	- He-He is a [[London dispersion forces]] bond, whereas H-H is a covalent bond
### Range of interactions between atoms
- [[Intermolecular forces(IMF)]] includes Van de Waals interactions, LDFs
	- occur between atoms or neutral molecules
- [[Bonds]] are more permanent than IMFs
	- Occur within a molecule
	- When breaking bonds, **energy is absorbed**
		- Because, needs input of energy
	- When forming bonds, **energy is released**
