   - weak
   - caused by fluctuations of electron density in the molecule
    - adjacent molecule
        - gets an induced dipole, meaning that due to a certain charge on the molecule next to it, another molecule becomes an opposite charge, leading to attraction. known as london dispersion force
    - Holds atoms together in low temperatures
    - if two atoms get too close, the electron clouds begin to repel each other
