- ### [[Coulombs law]]
    - opposite charges attract, like charges repel
    - as charges repel, potential energy decreases
    - as charges attract,, potential energy increases
- ### [[London dispersion forces]] (LDFs)
    - caused by fluctuations of electron density in the molecule
    - adjacent molecule
        - gets an induced dipole, meaning that due to a certain charge on the molecule next to it, another molecule becomes an opposite charge, leading to attraction. known as london dispersion force
    - Holds atoms together in low temperatures
    - if two atoms get too close, the electron clouds begin to repel each other
    - IMFs = intermolecular forces
### Interactions between simple molecules
- Helium and hydrogen in this case
