### [[definition of elasticity]]
- When quantity move proportionally more than price
	- This means that the elasticity is greater than 1

### [[total revenue]]
- Price * Quantity = Total revenue
	- basically, on the graph, multiply x and y
- How does it change:
	- If inelastic- increase in price = increase in revenue
	- Because, in the case of P * Q Q drop proportionally less than price[[definition of elasticity]]
		- Opposite occurs when it is elastic, as q drops proportionally more than P[[definition of elasticity]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230925131453.png]]
	- *basic rules*
	- When demand is inelastic, price and revenue move in the same direction, price increase = revenue increase
	- When demand is elastic, price and revenue move in opposite directions, price increase = revenue decrease
	- If demand is unit elastic (price elasticity = 1), total revenue remains constant when price changes
### Elasticity along a linear line
- Shifts between elastic and non-elastic even though slope remains the same
	- *slope is the ratio of changes between two variables, elasticity is the ratio of percentage changes in them*
	- at point of low and high quantity, linear demand curves are inelastic
	- High price and low quantity, curve is elastic
		- because: when price is low and customers are buying a lot, a 1 dollar change is massive, leading to the percentage of price increase being greater than quantity
		- at high and low quantity, a 1 dollar change is percentage wise much lower, leading to a price moving proportionally less than quantity

		- *DRAW THE RECTANGLE, compare at high price and low price*
### [[income elasticity of demand]]
- How the quantity demanded changes as consumer income changes.
![[Pasted image 20230925133306.png]]
- most goods = [[Normal goods]] higher income increases q demanded
	- elasticities vary heavily
	- food will have very low income elasticity as people buy it regardless of income
	- [[Engel's law]]: as a familyâ€™s income rises, the percent of its income spent on food declines, indicating an income elasticity less than one.
	- Luxuries will have large income elasticities as consumers will not buy this when income is low. [[Determinants of price elasticity of demand]]
- some goods = [[inferior goods]] Higher income decreases q demanded
	- inferior goods have negative income elasticity
### [[Cross price elasticity of demand]]
- Measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in price of another
- ![[Pasted image 20230925134759.png]]
- Depends on [[substitutes]] or [[complements]]
	- Substitutes
		- cross price elasticity is positive
		- For example, hot dogs vs hamburgers
			- when hot dogs price increase, hamburgers get grilled
			- P of hot dogs and burgers move in the same direction, cross price elasticity is positive
	- Complements
		- cross price elasticity is negative
			- increase in price of computers likely leads to a decrease in demand of software
### [[Elasticity of supply]]
- [[Elasticity equation]]
- [[supply curves]]
	- Perfectly inelastic = supply curve vertical
	- Perfectly elastic = supply curve horizontal
	- ![[Pasted image 20230925141943.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20230925160033.png]]
	- In the above figure, shows the relation between amount supply and the elasticity of supply
		- When low levels are supply, the elasticity is high, meaning firms will respond substantially to price increases. 
			- It also means that in this region, firms have excess amounts production available
		- When high levels of supply, elasticity is low, as increasing production is now hard, meaning firms have little to no excess production capabilities
### applications of supply demand and elasticity
- lets say, wheat is sold at 3$ a bushel, a discovery comes in that allows wheat to be produced much more efficiently, what would this do to price?
	- It would decrease it, as it has no effect on demand, but increases supply.
