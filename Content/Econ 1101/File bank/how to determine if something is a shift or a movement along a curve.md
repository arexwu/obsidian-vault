- **Determinants of Supply If any of the following shift, than its a shift of the curve**

|•|Price of inputs|
|---|---|
|•|Production technology|
|•|Number of producers|
|•|Expectations of producers|

curve shift
    
 - When supply increases the curve shifts right
    - same with demand
    - **Effects of Shifts in Demand or Supply on Equilibrium**

||No Change in Supply|Increase in Supply|Decrease in Supply|
|---|---|---|---|
|No Change in Demand|P and Q unchanged|P ↓, Q ↑|P ↑, Q ↓|
|Increase in Demand|P ↑, Q ↑|P ?, Q ↑|P ↑, Q ?|
|Decrease in Demand|P ↓, Q ↓|P ↓, Q ?|P ?, Q ↓|

- the curve that shifts the most determines the effect on the undetermined equilibrium object
        - when supply shifts larger than demand, downward pressure from the increase in supply overpowers the upward pressure from increased demand
        - when demand shifts larger than supply, upward pressure from the increase in supply overpowers the downward pressure of supply increasing
- If the price of a complement goes down, the other complement’s demand goes up, leading to upward pressure causing prices to go up
