- When quantity move proportionally more than price
	- This means that the elasticity is greater than 1
- The willingness of sellers and buyers to leave the market when conditions worsen
- how easily someone can respond to price changes
### unit elasticity
- situation where a change in one variable results in an equally proportional change in another variable
### values of elasticity
- if elasticity is less than 1 = non elastic
- if elasticity is greater than 1 = elastic
- if elasticity is equal to 1 = unit elastic
- very big elasticity is very sensitive to price
