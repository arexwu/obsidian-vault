### [[Taxes]]
- how taxes on sellers affect market outcomes
	- immediate impact on sellers
		- shift in supply
	- supply curve shifts left
	- leading to higher equilibrium price
	- lower equilibrium market
	- taxes reduce the size of the market
	- supply shifts to the left by exactly the tax amount
		- new price - old price = tax amount
	- both sides carry the tax burden equally
		- both suppliers and buyers pay more
	- may discourage market activity
- How taxes on buyers affect market outcomes
	-  shifts demand to the left
	- lowers equilibrium price
	- but buyers still receive higher price
- Elasticity and [[tax incidence]] [[definition of elasticity]]
	- Very elastic supply and relatively inelastic demand
		- sellers bear a small burden of tax
		- buyer bear most of the burden
	- Inelastic supply very elastic demand
		- sellers bear most of the burden
		- buyers bear a small burden
	- burden falls on the side of the least elastic
- When working with taxes, always working towards the left side
	- decreases amount of exchange
### subsidy
- Always works from the right hand side
	- increases the amount of exchange
