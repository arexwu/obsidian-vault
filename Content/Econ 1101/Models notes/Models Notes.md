### [[factor market]]
	- when firms buy labor and services from households
### [[Product market]]
	- when firms buy labor and services from households
### [[Quantity demanded]]
    - amount of goods buyer can buy at a certain price
### [[Demand curve]]
    
    - graph that shows the entire relationship between price and quantity of a good
### [[Demand schedule]]
    
    - demand curve but in a table
### [[Law of demand]]
    
    - All things being equal quantity of demanded falls when price of good rises
### [[how to determine if something is a shift or a movement along a curve]]
    
  - **Determinants of Supply If any of the following shift, than its a shift of the curve**
    
    |•|Price of inputs|
    |---|---|
    |•|Production technology|
    |•|Number of producers|
    |•|Expectations of producers|
    
### [[supply v shortage]]
- For a surplus in a market
    
    - Buyers are unwilling to buy at amounts that sellers are willing to sell at. This causes sellers to offer a lower price.
    - This also means that current market price is too high so buyers are unwilling to buy more
#### For a shortage in a market
    
    - Buyers are are willing to buy more than the amount a supplier is willing to supply at that price
    - current market prices are too low so that buyers are willing to buy more than supply
#### curve shift
    
   - When supply increases the curve shifts right
    - same with demand
    - **Effects of Shifts in Demand or Supply on Equilibrium**
    
   ||No Change in Supply|Increase in Supply|Decrease in Supply|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |No Change in Demand|P and Q unchanged|P ↓, Q ↑|P ↑, Q ↓|
    |Increase in Demand|P ↑, Q ↑|P ?, Q ↑|P ↑, Q ?|
    |Decrease in Demand|P ↓, Q ↓|P ↓, Q ?|P ?, Q ↓|
    
   - the curve that shifts the most determines the effect on the undetermined equilibrium object
        - when supply shifts larger than demand, downward pressure from the increase in supply overpowers the upward pressure from increased demand
        - when demand shifts larger than supply, upward pressure from the increase in supply overpowers the downward pressure of supply increasing
- If the price of a complement goes down, the other complement’s demand goes up, leading to upward pressure causing prices to go up
    
- 2.1 question 7
    
    - Equillibrium is always when prices match, not always median
- Office hours
    
    - Homework 2 15 draw original graph onto new graphs and check shift
- demand is elastic
    
    - price elasticity of demand ≥ 1
    - inelastic when demand < 1
    - Ex. If price is increases by 1% and Qd decreases by 2% then Ed = 2 elastic
- Flatter the demand curve, the greater the elasticity
    
-[[ Determinants of price elasticity of demand]] (what makes a good elasticity)
    - Availability of close substitutes
        - IE drugs with generics
        - more substitutes = more elastic demand
            - satisfy the same needs, like hot dog/hamburger
        - more firms! monopoly = price is high
    - Necessities vs Luxury
        - Necessities = inelastic
        - luxuries = elastic
    - Definition of market
        - narrowly defined markets = more elastic demand
            - Beethoven vs classical music
                - classical has many different composers
    - Time horizon
        - demand is more elastic over over time horizons
            - Demand is always elastic over the long run
            - if demand is perfectly inelastic, the demand curve is completely vertical
            - if demand is perfectly elastic, demand curve is completely horizontal and the elasticity is infinite
- [[Elasticity equation]] (basically just finding the slope)
    
    - e = elasticity
        
    - Q = quantity demanded
        
    - P = price demanded
