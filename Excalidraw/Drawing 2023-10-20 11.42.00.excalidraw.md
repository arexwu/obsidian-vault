# Text Elements
Covalent bonds- sharing electrons between two atoms; these compounds
often have low boiling and melting points as the energy needed to break 
these bonds is not excessively high. Examples are CO2, 
Hydrogen bonds- A hydrogen atom bonded to a strongly negative dipole 
of another atom. It is a type of dipole-dipole interaction. Very low 
boiling points, these bonds are not as strong as actual covalent bonds 
but not as weak as LDFs, so they require a little energy to break.
Ionic bonds- Attraction between oppositely charged ions. These have 
very high melting/boiling points as they are very strong and require a lot of 
energy to break these bonds.
