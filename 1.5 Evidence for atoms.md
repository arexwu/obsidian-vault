### [[dalton's atomic theory]]
- Elements are composed of small indivisible, indestructible particles called atoms
- All atoms of an element are identical and have the same mass and properties
- atoms of a given element are different from atoms of other elements
- compounds are formed by combinations of atoms of two or more elements
- Chemical reactions are due to the rearrangements of atoms, and atoms are neither created or destroyed during a reaction
### first evidence of atoms
- Brownian motion
	- tiny pollen grains suspended in still water moved around in complex paths
	- this was later replicated during dalton's experiments with gases
