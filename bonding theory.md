- in metals, a lot of atoms of metals are together meaning that the atomic orbitals will combine to form a ton of molecular orbits energy gap becomes smaller
	- bonding and antibonding overlap, so electrons can move freely, explaining conductivity
	- basically, not all orbitals are full, allowing for electrons to flow through
