- C and E are the losses to buyers and sellers from the tax raised by the government, deadweight loss
	- [[10 principles of economics#4. people respond to incentives]] taxes give people incentive not to consume and sellers to not produce
		-  Taxes cause [[deadweight loss]]es because they prevent buyers and sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade

## determinants of [[deadweight loss]]
- Relatively inelastic markets have a much lower deadweight loss 
	- greater the elasticity the greater the deadweight loss
## deadweight loss and tax revenue as taxes vary
- ![[Pasted image 20231005172443.png]]
- Deadweight loss depends on the square of the size of the tax
- There is a balance, a super high tax won't actually mean more revenue, as the market would shrink so much that the revenue will fall.
# Chapter in a nutshell
- Tax on goods reduces welfare of buyers and sellers of the good, which often times exceeds the revenue the tax raises, this is the deadweight loss
- Taxes have deadweight losses because it causes buyers to consume and sellers to produce less
	- larger elasticities have higher deadweight losses as people are more responsive to changes.
- [[10 principles of economics#4. people respond to incentives]] Taxes give an incentive for people to stop spending and producing
- As tax increases, deadweight loss increases
	- Tax revenue does not increase continually, eventually, tax will increase to the point where the market is so small that tax revenue will decrease
