# De Broglie wavelength
- Wavelength where particles having the same properties as waves
- λ = h/mv
	- v = velocity of light
# Heisenberg uncertainty principle
- Δmv × Δx > h/2π,
	- Δmv the uncertainty in momentum of the particle
	- Δx uncertainty of its position in space
- Basically, if we know exactly where an object is, we will have no idea about it's velocity, and if we know exactly momentum, we will have no idea where it is
- this disproved the Bohr Model, as it attempted to define both exact position and the energy
