# properties of [[metals]]
- shiny
- conduct electricity and heat
- malleable and ductile
- most are grey, but some are colored
- how does bonding in metals explain their properties?
# [[bonding theory]]
- in metals, a lot of atoms of metals are together meaning that the atomic orbitals will combine to form a ton of molecular orbits energy gap becomes smaller
	- bonding and antibonding overlap, so electrons can move freely, explaining conductivity
	- basically, not all orbitals are full, allowing for electrons to flow through
# why are metals shiny?
- metals interact with all wavelengths of light, the photons enter and leave almost immediately causing drops in energy, thereby emitting light(shiny)
- photons of many wavelengths are absorbed and reemitted
# why are metals malleable and ductile?
- metal atoms are packed in layers, so they can move around

- "sea of electrons"
	- because electrons move around freely, conductive
# [[band theory]]

- metals= conductor
	- metallic bonds
- metalloid= semiconductor
	- treat based on which stair step on the periodic table
	- treat as metals above line, nonmetals below line
- nonmetal = insulator
	- covalent
