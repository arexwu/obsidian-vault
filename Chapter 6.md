### [[price floor]]
- the price cannot fall below this level
### [[price ceiling]]
- the price cannot go above this level
# how price ceilings affect market outcomes
- Non-binding price ceiling
	- if the equilibrium price is below the price ceiling
	- ceiling has no effect on the price or quantity sold
- ![[Pasted image 20231001143313.png]]
- Binding price ceiling
	- When the price ceiling undercuts the equilibrium price
	- causes suppliers to pull out of market
	- causes shortage as demand exceeds supply
		- shortage = upwards pressure on price
- When a government imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, shortage arises, causing goods to need to be rationed 
## Case study on increasing crude oil prices
- When OPEC increased prices on petroleum, gas prices skyrocketed
	- while increasing the price of petroleum would increase gas prices, US government regulation forced gasoline prices down so when the equilibrium prices rose, more sellers moved out of the market when the price of manufacturing rose, this caused there to be a shortage of gasoline

## Case study on price ceilings on housing
- In the short run, 
	- demand is relatively inelastic as tenants need time to adjust their living arrangements
	- supply is relatively inelastic as landlords need time to acquire new buildings
	- This means that rent control in the short run, appeals to tenants
	- this also means that in the short run, the lower housing prices cause a very small shortage in the amount of housing
- In the long run,
	- Demand is more elastic as people find their own apartments rather than attempting to live with roommates
	- Supply is more elastic as landlords respond to low rents by not building new housing and not maintaining old housing
	- This means that there is now a massive shortage in the housing market as demand grows by supply fails to grow with it
- [[10 principles of economics#4. people respond to incentives]]
	- in a well functioning market, landlords can charge higher prices if they keep buildings clean and safe
		- rent control prevents that as people will move in no matter what
	- Rent control reduces price but limits quality and quantity
# How [[price floor]]s affect market outcomes
- binding price floor causes a surplus
	- surplus = downward pressure on price
## Case Study : Minimum wage
- When minimum wage rises, there is a surplus of labor, leading to unemployment
	- this is because business will not want to hire at a certain price
- *REMEMBER: Economy contains many different kinds of workers. High skill experienced workers are not bound by minimum wage laws, whereas low skill workers like teenagers are bound by them*
- 10% increase in minimum wage decreases teenage employment by 1-3%

# Overview on price controls
- Economist generally believe that price controls are generally a worse way of improving market outcomes
- Government subsidies are often better at controlling price than price controls
# [[affect of taxes on market outcomes]]
# How taxes on sellers affect market outcomes
- [[tax incidence]]
	- study of how the burden of a tax is distributed among the various people in the economy
- $0.5 tax on ice cream cones
	- Immediate impact of tax is on sellers
		- Tax is not imposed on buyers 
		- quantity demanded makes price the same
		- Shifts supply curve
	- the supply curve would shift upwards by the exact amount of the tax
		- causing the demand to decrease
	- sellers sell less, buyers buy less
		- reduces the size of the market
	- ![[Pasted image 20231001162454.png]]
- Implications
	- who pays the tax?
		- Sellers pay it initially
		- but buyers take the burden afterwards
	- Taxes discourage market activity
	- Buyers and sellers share tax burden
		- buyers pay more
		- sellers receive less
# How taxes on buyers affect market outcomes
- 0.5$ tax on buyers
	- The immediate impact is on the demand
		- causes demand curve to the left
	- Sellers would have to reduce prices by 0.5$
	- Sellers get less, buyers pay more
- ![[Pasted image 20231001164358.png]]
- Implications
	- same as when taxes are levied on sellers but just reverse
	- the wedge remains the same
	- regardless of who pays the tax, the market will reach equilibrium, causing both parties to take the burden
	- A lawmaker can decide whether taxes come from a seller or buyer's pocket but cannot decide the true burden of a tax
# Elasticity and Tax Incidence
- ![[Pasted image 20231001170958.png]]
- Tax in market with very elastic supply and inelastic demand leaves buyers with most of the burden
- Tax in market with very inelastic supply and elastic demand leaves sellers with most of the burden
- The less elastic, the more burden
	- [[definition of elasticity]]also means the willingness of buyers and sellers to leave the market when conditions worsen
	- For example, payroll tax
		- labor is less elastic than demand
			- so payroll tax is burdened on workers
- Per unit tax = price consumers pay - price producers receive
## Case Study who pays luxury tax
- Luxury tax
	- Market for yachts = inelastic
	- demand for yachts= very elastic
	- this caused many workers in dockyards that build yachts to be laid off as the burden of the tax was mostly laid on the companies
# Chapter in a nutshell
- Price ceilings are the maximum price of a good/service
	- if it is below equilibrium price = non binding
	- above= binding = shortage
		- because, demand exceeds supply
- Price floors are minimum price of a good/service
	- if it is above equilibrium price = binding = surplus
		- supply exceed demand
	- below = non binding
- Tax = shrinks market size 
	- equilibrium quantity falls
	- places a wedge between buyers and sellers
		- when market moves to new equillibrium because of taxes, both parties share the burden
	- tax incidence depends on elasticities of supply/demand
		- less elastic = more burden
