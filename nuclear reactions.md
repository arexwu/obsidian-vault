- involves nucleus
- often result in change in element
- mass is NOT conserved
- mass is converted into energy per E=mc^2
- E = [[binding energy]]

# 3 types of reactions
-  fusion: adding nuclei together
- fission: breaking a nucleus apart
- fragmentation of heavy nuclei to form lighter, more stable ones and energy
- radioactive decay: emitting particles
- At very high temperatures nuclear fusion can occur
- ![[Pasted image 20231023222732.png]]
- At very high temps, electrons are stripped away so that they overcome the attraction to the nucleus. this becomes plasma
# [[strong force]]
- strongest force but works in very small distances
	- only works in the distance of the diameter of the nucleus.
- binds protons and neutrons together, stronger than the proton proton repulsion
- most stable element is iron
	- all elements will want to be iron
	- fusion occurs before iron
	- fission afterwards
# [[Radioactivity]]
-  nucleus emits/captures particles and energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation
	- Most common types
		- alpha particle emission
		- beta particle emission
			- electron emission
			- positron emission
		- electron capture
			- nucleus captures a core electron and converts it into a proton
		- gamma radiation emission
- why do some nuclei decay
- [[Stable nuclei]]
	- number of neutrons generally are more than protons so strong force overcomes P+ P+ repulsion
	- have <92 protons
	- close to 1:1 neutron/proton ratio
- number of atoms in universe is decreasing
