# Bohr Model
- came from observations of spectra and the [[photoelectric effect]]
- Hypothesis 1
	- electrons within an atom can only travel along certain orbits at a fixed distance from the nucleus
- Hypothesis 2 
	- electrons within an atom can jump from one orbit to another, but it requires either the capture or release of energy(photon)
		- lower orbits are less energetic, closer to the nucleus, and more stable
		- high orbits are high energy, far from the nucleus and less stable
- Only worked for hydrogen atoms
