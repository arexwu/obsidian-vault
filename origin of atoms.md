- H, He, Li atoms were formed immediately after the big bang
	- all other heavier atoms were formed in the stars. 
- Everything in the universe is moving away from us
# [[Doppler effect]]
- wavelength depends on what observer is doing
	- wavelength depends on what the observer is doing.
	- If something emitting light is moving towards you, the wavelength bunches up
	- moving out, the wavelengths stretch out.
	- red shift is generally expansion,
		- red light has long, "stretched" wavelength
- universe is moving away from us with increasing speed
# Big bang evidence
- red shift for universe
- CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation)
- elements 1-3 formed from big bang
- elements 4-12 formed in red giants
- elements to 26 formed in supergiant
- all else in supernova
