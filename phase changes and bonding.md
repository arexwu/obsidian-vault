- melting and boiling 
	- absorbs energy
	- happens between particles
	- energy comes from the surroundings
	- when melting, the interactions between particles must be overcome so they move relative to each other(causes liquid to flow)
	- the magnitude of the melting point and boiling point provides estimate of the strength of the attractive interactions
- Freezing and condensing
	- releases energy
	- between particles
	- energy goes to the surroundings
