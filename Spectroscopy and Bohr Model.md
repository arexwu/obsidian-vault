### Issues with Rutherford's model
- model does not explain atomic absorption and emission spectra
- Model conflicts with the laws of physics, the atom would implode if the model was correct
### Bohr model
- Electrons orbit around nucleus
	- the ones closest to nucleus is lowest energy furthest is higher energy
	- when an electron absorbs a photon, the electron moves to a higher, more energetic orbit
		- this produces an absorption spectrum
			- higher energy the electron rises higher energy light absorbed
	- when an electron emits a photon, the electron moves to a lower less energetic orbit
		- this would produce an emission spectrum
			- the higher energy the electron falls from, the higher energy light
	- What about photoelectric effect
		- An atom absorbs a photon resulting in the ejection of the electron, leading to a n level = infinity
			- this is called ionization
- Orbits have definite energies and are at definite distances from nucleus.
	- this is Bohr's mistake
- Energies of electrons in atoms are quantized
- explains emission and absorption spectra by invoking discrete energy levels characterize by quantum numbers (n)
- Photons of electromagnetic energy are emitted or absorbed by atoms as electrons move from one energy level to another
- The energy of photons correspond to the difference in energy between electron orbits
- Issues with Bohr Model
	- its wrong, except for hydrogen
	- we don't know where the electron is
	- useful for thinking about electrons having quantified energies
- energy diagrams
