11. _Calculate molar mass_
12. _Balance chemical equations_
13. _Relate mole ratios of products/reactants_
14. _Apply stoichiometry to calculate moles/mass/atoms in a chemical reaction_
15. _Identify a limiting reactant_
16. _Solve limiting reactant problems (calculate amount of product/reactant used/remaining)_
17. _Determine percent yield_
18. _Determine molarity and use as a conversion factor when appropriate_
19. _Predict products of aqueous reactions_
20. _Write a net ionic equation_
	- everything in the solid, with charges and matter state
24. Describe the evidence for the existence of atoms
26. Describe Dalton's atomic theory
	- All matter is made of atoms
	- all atoms in the same element are the same
		- proven wrong with isotopes
	- atoms are indestructible and undividable
		- proven wrong with the discovery of protons, neutrons and electrons
		- Nuke!
	- Atoms of different elements contain different mass
1. Describe Thomson's experiment
	- Cathode ray tube experiment
		- experiment indicated that the atom was negatively charged
		- he also found that the particles in the CRT were from the metal itself as the metal type did not matter in the behavior of the cathode rays
	- This led to the creation of the plum pudding model
		- ball of matter with electrons studded here and there
1. Describe Rutherford's experiment
	- gold foil experiment
	- 
1. Describe and identify isotopes
	- same protons, different number of neutrons
		- just minus isotope number by atomic number for amount of neutrons
		- 
1. Determine the number of protons, electrons, and neutrons present in an atom of a particular isotope
2. Use isotope notation (AZE notation) to describe a given atom of a particular element
3. Identify the force(s) acting between two particles
4. Draw total, potential, and kinetic energy diagrams to describe the interactions between particles

6. Describe London dispersion forces and their role in the states of matter
	- london dispersion forces are forces that occur when a temporary dipole is formed in an atom, causing attractions due to coulombs law.
	- London dispersion forces attract atoms together, and when kinetic energy is low enough, it can shift gases into liquid, as there is not enough energy within the system to break the attraction(bottom of energy well)
7. Describe a covalent bond and how it is different from London dispersion forces
	- [[Why do diatomic molecules happen]] [[Bonds]]
	- Covalent bonds are much stronger than LDFs as they occur within a molecule, they happen when atoms transfer/share valence electrons. LDF's occur outside the molecule, and have a much smaller energy well than bonds.
