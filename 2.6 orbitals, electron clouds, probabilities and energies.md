- All atoms are electrically neutral
- energy required for removing an electron from an atom differs for each element
	- energy required depends on the net positive charge on the nucleus and atomic radius
- Atomic size depends on size of electron cloud
	- as atoms get heavier, the volume gets smaller
		- the protons attract the electrons more, causing atomic radius to shrink
