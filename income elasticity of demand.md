How the quantity demanded changes as consumer income changes.

- most goods = [[Normal goods]] higher income increases q demanded
	- elasticities vary heavily
	- food will have very low income elasticity as people buy it regardless of income
	- [[Engel's law]]: as a familyâ€™s income rises, the percent of its income spent on food declines, indicating an income elasticity less than one.
	- Luxuries will have large income elasticities as consumers will not buy this when income is low. [[Determinants of price elasticity of demand]]
- some goods = [[inferior goods]] Higher income decreases q demanded
	- inferior goods have negative income elasticity
