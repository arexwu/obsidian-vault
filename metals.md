# properties of metals
- shiny
- conduct electricity and heat
- malleable and ductile
- most are grey, but some are colored
- how does bonding in metals explain their properties?
# why are metals shiny?
- metals interact with all wavelengths of light, the photons enter and leave almost immediately causing drops in energy, thereby emitting light(shiny)
- photons of many wavelengths are absorbed and reemitted
# why are metals malleable and ductile?
- metal atoms are packed in layers, so they can move around

- why do [[metals]] melt
	-  cores are held together by a sea of electrons, so when the cores move, the electrons move with them
- "sea of electrons"
	- because electrons move around freely, conductive
-  metals= conductor
	- metallic bonds
